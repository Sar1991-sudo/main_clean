# Make a Python program, which prompts user for a car brand and model. After user inputs, do print the car brand and model sentence with two print commands using “sep” and “end” parameters.

# Example program run:

# Program starting.
print("Program starting.")
# Insert car brand: Toyota
car_brand = input("Insert car brand: ")
# Insert car model: Corolla
car_model = input("Insert car model: ")
# Car brand is "Toyota" and the model is 'Corolla'.
print("Car brand is", f'"{car_brand}"', "and the model is", f"'{car_model}'.", sep=" ", end="\n")
# Program ending.
print("Program ending.")
