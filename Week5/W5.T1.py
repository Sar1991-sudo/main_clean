# Create a Python program, which contains a main-function. The program must print the content in the same way as in the example program run below, but only from within the main-function. Top-level print commands are not allowed. The main-function must also return None value at the end of the function.

# Example program run

# Program starting.
# Hello from main function!
def main():
    print("Program starting")
    print("Hello from main function!")
    print("Program ending")
    return None
# Program ending.
main()
