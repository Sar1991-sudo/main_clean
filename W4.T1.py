# Create a Python program which prompts user to insert two integers. Use these integers together with the “for-loop” structure to create behaviour like in the example program example run below.

# Note! the autograding tool will test that the correct structure has been applied.

# Example program runs

# run 1 run 2 run 3


# Program starting.
print("Program starting.")
# Insert starting value: 1
Start = int(input("Insert starting value: "))
# Insert stopping value: 10
Stop = int(input("Insert stopping value: "))

# Starting for-loop:
for i in range(Start, Stop + 1):
    print(i)
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10

# Program ending.
print("Program ending.")
