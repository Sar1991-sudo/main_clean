# Create a program with a plain menu.

# Prompt username first
# Make program menu with following options:
# Print welcome message
# Welcome {Name}!
# Exit
# Exiting...
# Prompt user to choose option “Your choice:”
# Perform actions based on the user input
# Creating menus like this is a really handy way to make tiny text-based programs and there will be more exercises like this in the future.

# The expectation at this point is that the user is able to choose option by inserting corresponding number. No error handling is required, it will be introduced later.

# Other possible output variats:

# Unknown option.
# Example program runs


# Program starting.
print("Program starting.")

# This is a program with simple menu, where you can choose which operation the program performs.
print("This is a program with simple menu, where you can choose which operation the program performs.")

# Before the menu, please insert your name: John
name = input("Before the menu, please insert your name: ")
print("")

# Options:
print("Options:")
# 1 - Print welcome message
print("1 - Print welcome message")
# 0 - Exit
print("0 - Exit")
# Your choice: 1
choice = input("Your choice: ")

if (choice == "1"):
    print(f"Welcome {name}!")
elif (choice == "0"):
    print("Exiting...")
else:
    print("Unknown option.")

# Program ending.
print("Program ending.")
